# Python-PCAP-Analyser
This is a Python project for a university course on network security. The aim of the project is to develop a tool that can analyse PCAP (Packet Capture) files and extract data from it without using external libraries, such as PyPCAPKit or Scapy. An additional feature has been added for Port Scanning.
